# Monte Carlo Simulation for Project Budgeting and Workforce Allocation

This Flask-based web application performs Monte Carlo simulations to assess budget and workforce risks in project portfolios. It processes historical variance data, estimates probabilities, and identifies the most critical projects based on predefined confidence intervals.

## Features
- Upload historical data for cost estimates, project budgets, and workforce allocation.
- Automatically process and clean data for analysis.
- Perform Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate project risk.
- Generate histograms and scatter plots to visualize distributions.
- Identify the most critical projects based on risk metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python application.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Upload required Excel files containing historical data.
2. Define expected budget and workforce availability.
3. Configure tolerance interval thresholds.
4. Run the simulation and analyze results through generated plots and reports.
